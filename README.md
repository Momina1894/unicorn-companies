# Unicorns Data Analysis
This project analyzes data on unicorn companies, identifying trends, insights, and patterns within the startup ecosystem. Using Python, we explore the relationships between factors such as company valuations, investor involvement, financial stages, and the industries and countries where these unicorns emerge.
